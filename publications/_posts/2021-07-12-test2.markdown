An device-algorithm co-design is proposed to emulate human retina and the affordable learning paradigm. Relying on a bottle-brush-shaped semiconducting p-NDI with efficient exciton-dissociations and through-space charge-transport characteristics, a wearable transistor-based dynamic in-sensor Reservoir-Computing system manifesting excellent separability, fading memory, and echo state property on different tasks is developed. The RC recognizes handwritten letters and numbers, and classifies diverse costumes with accuracies higher than all reported organic semiconductors. In addition to 2D images, the spatiotemporal dynamics of RC naturally extract features of event-based videos, classifying 3 types of hand gestures at an accuracy of 98.62%. Further, the computing cost is significantly lower than that of the conventional artificial-neural-networks.
