We present a hardware-software co-design to address these challenges, by designing an echo state graph neural network based on random resistor arrays, which are built from low-cost, nanoscale and stackable resistors for efficient in-memory computing. The approach leverages the intrinsic stochasticity of dielectric breakdown in the resistors to implement random projections in hardware for an echo state network that effectively minimizes the training complexity thanks to its fixed and random weights. The system demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on both graph classification and node classification tasks with significant improvement of energy efficiency and reduction of backward pass complexity compared to conventional graph learning. The results point to a promising direction for the next generation AI system for graph learning.
