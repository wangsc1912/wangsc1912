Graph neural networks, the machine learning models for handling graph-structured data, face significant challenges when running on conventional digital hardware, including the von Neumann bottleneck in efficiency incurred by physically separated memory and processing units, and a high training cost. Here we present a hardware-software co-design to address these challenges, by designing an echo state graph neural network based on random resistor arrays, which are built from low-cost, nanoscale and stackable resistors for efficient in-memory computing. The approach leverages the intrinsic stochasticity of dielectric breakdown in the resistors to implement random projections in hardware for an echo state network that effectively minimizes the training complexity thanks to its fixed and random weights. The system demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on both graph classification using the MUTAG and COLLAB datasets and node classification using the CORA dataset, achieving 2.16×, 35.42×, and 40.37× improvement of energy efficiency for a projected random resistor-based hybrid analogue-digital system over a state-of-the-art graphics processing unit and 99.35%, 99.99%, and 91.40% reduction of backward pass complexity compared to conventional graph learning. The results point to a promising direction for the next generation AI system for graph learning.
